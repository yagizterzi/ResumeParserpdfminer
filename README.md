# Simple Resume Parser with Pdfminer

A simple resume parser built using Python and [pdfminer.six](https://github.com/pdfminer/pdfminer.six) to extract information from PDF resumes.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use pdfminer to extract text from PDF files and perform basic parsing to retrieve key details from resumes. Itâ€™s designed to be simple, modular, and easy to extend for more complex use cases.

## Features

- **PDF Text Extraction:** Leverages pdfminer.six to extract text from PDF files.
- **Basic Parsing Logic:** Identifies and extracts key information such as name, contact details, and skills.
- **Command-line Interface:** Run the parser via command line with a provided PDF resume.
- **Easy to Customize:** Modular code structure makes it simple to add or modify parsing rules.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [pdfminer.six](https://pypi.org/project/pdfminer.six/)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-resume-parser.git
   ```

2. **Change to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd ResumeParserpdfminer
   ```

3. **(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install pdfminer
   pip install re
   ```

## Usage

Run the resume parser by specifying the path to a PDF resume:

```bash
python resume_parser.py path/to/yourresume.pdf
```

The script will extract the text from the PDF, apply basic parsing rules, and print the extracted information to the console.

## Customization

You can modify the parsing logic in `resume_parser.py` to tailor the extraction process to your specific needs. For example, you might want to add additional regular expressions or natural language processing techniques to better capture complex resume formats.
